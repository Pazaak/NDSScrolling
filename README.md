# NDSScrolling
Delving into good, old scrolling techniques with DevKitPRO in the NDS.

This may seem a very odd project to be working in 2015, but I have my reasons. I did this little homebrew as a part of an assignment on my last year in Informatics Engineering Degree. We had been asked to do something for the Nintendo DS. This could be anything ranging from full fleshed videogames to an study of the wifi capabilities of the console. I decided to investigate and try to emulate scrolling techniques seen in sidescrollers from the NES era.

The project uses DevKitPRO environment, was programmed in C, uses stolen graphics from Megaman and some spritework done by myself (we had no time for more). Also, the entirety of the project was made in Spanish as the assignment was in that language too. Sorry to those guys who what deep explanations of the wonderful scrolling techniques of my 2D vertical shooter with no enemies.

In this repository you can find:

Tipo 1: Contains one example of the most basic scrolling technique; when the character touches the border of the screen, the background autoscrolls into the next background. This is the main stage-change mechanic of The Legend of Zelda in the NES.

Tipo 2: Features the most seen scrolling technique that continues to this days; the camera is central to the main character and the background loads as he/she/it walks. This is the main scrolling technique of Megaman, Castlevania, Metroid, Super Mario Bros., etc.

Tipo 3: Making use of spritework made by myself (pretty proud), I've done a vertical shooter what uses the resources of the Nintendo DS more efficiently than the other two scrolling techniques here.

Versiones previas de archivos fuente: I did this project before I had a git account, so I had to take care of version control in a rustical way. This are the files generated in various steps of the implementation.

memoriaFabregues2015: Just a report of the work done. It's in Spanish, sorry.
